I am a third-year Physics undergraduate at University of Oxford.

## Research interests

I am interested in astrophysics, particularly in high-energy phenomena such as black hole accretion and tidal disruption events. I am also interested in the development of symbolic and numerical tools for the study of strong-field gravity.
