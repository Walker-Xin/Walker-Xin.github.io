I am a third-year Physics undergraduate at Exeter College, University of Oxford. I am actively exploring research in theoretical astrophysics and aspire to do a PhD in the field.

Prior to university, I completed my O- and A-levels in Singapore under the MOE JM3 Scholarship (otherwise known as the "SM1" scholarship). There, I participated in regional competitions such as the Singapore Physics Olympiad, and developed a keen interest in theoretical physics.

## Research interests

I am particularly interested in high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as black hole accretion and tidal disruption events. I am also interested in the development of symbolic and numerical tools for the study of general relativity and strong-field gravity.

In the summer of 2024, I worked with [Dr. A. Mummery](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/mummery) on tidal forces in general relativity. We developed a general, analytic framework for computing the local tidal tensor along a time-like geodesic in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This work is currently being prepared for publication.

I am now working on an extension to the above project, where I wish to apply our theoretical results to predict rates of relativistic tidal disruption events. This work is supervised by [Prof. J. Binney](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/binney) and [Dr. Y. B. Ginat](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/ginat) under the Dyson Fellows programme, where we learn about frontier research in galactic dynamics.

I am also working with [Dr. M. Rozner](https://morozner.wixsite.com/mysite) under a summer internship programme at Institue of Astronomy, University of Cambridge. We are generalising Heggie's law to binaries with non-zero eccentricity and using numerical 3-body simulations to verify the theoretical predictions.

## Hobbies

I play video games competitively. I am currently the IGL (in-game leader) for Counter-Strike team of the Oxford University eSports Society.

I also brew filter coffee (V60 and aeropress) and enjoy reading science fiction and social science books.
